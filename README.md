# ðŸ›³ Titanic Dataset Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis) ðŸ“Š

Hi! I'm **Arfi Nadhifa Hananti**, a participant of **Faculty of Data (Data Science & Data Analyst) - Digital Skill Fair Batch 38 by dibimbing.id**.

This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the famous Titanic dataset. This analysis was conducted as part of my learning journey in the data science field.

---

## ðŸ§  Objectives

The main goals of this EDA project are:

- ðŸ“Š Understand the structure and characteristics of the Titanic dataset  
- ðŸ“‹ Generate statistical summaries of numerical and categorical data  
- ðŸ§¹ Identify and handle missing values and duplicate records  
- ðŸ“ˆ Visualize data to extract insights and patterns  

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly available through .

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Power BI

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings

Some of the insights gained from the analysis include:

- The dataset contains a total of 499 passengers, made up of 288 males (57.72%) and 211 females (42.28%).
- The average age of the passengers is 35.79 years, with most of them falling into the adult age group. This shows that the majority of passengers were people in their productive years.
- Looking at the survival status, 196 out of 211 female passengers (92.89%) survived, while only 73 out of 288 male passengers (25.35%) made it.
- Females had a much higher survival rate, likely due to the "women and children first" evacuation policy.
- Most passengers were adults, which matches the typical profile of Titanic travelers at the time.
- Males had a lower chance of survival, which suggests unequal access to rescue efforts.
